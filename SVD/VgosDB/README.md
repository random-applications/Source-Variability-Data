# VgosDB

This directory is designed to hold the downloaded and extracted *VgosDB* files that provide the data for this application. Each file is named under the *VGOS* session name assigned to the session of which the data comes from.

VgosDB files will be downloaded to this directory in *TAR.GZ* file format, and then extracted into a file folder. Once the extraction is complete, the *TAR.GZ* file will be deleted.

It is suggested not to delete *VgosDB* files that have been successfully downloaded or successfully extracted such they can be used for later runs of the program. However, if either of these files are only partially loaded, possibily fatal errors will occur and the program is likely to crash. To avoid this, please delete these incomplete files (when the program is not running).
