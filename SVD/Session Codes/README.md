# Session Codes

This directory is designed to hold catalogues of all the *VGOS* and *MK3* format session names for each *VLBI* session. A new catalogue file is made for each year with *incomplete* files being produced for the current year. These catalogues are used by the program to efficiently find the entire session name from a single enterred session code. The catalogue files wil automatically update every time the program connects to the internet.

Due to the use of the old *MK3* name format, the catalogue files from 1979 to 2022 were manually created by the author and will not automatically be replaced by the program if removed.
